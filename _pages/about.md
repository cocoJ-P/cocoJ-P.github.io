ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m **Jiashun Pang**(å˜‰é¡º åºž), exploring the intersection of **Mechanics, Mathematics, and AI4Science**.  
I build frameworks like **MosaicX**, **OntoPilot**, and **Sessync** to push toward the vision of a *Machine Scientist*.  

My work also involves the **Semantic Web and ontology-based knowledge representation**, where I design tools for **ontology modeling, semantic reasoning, and knowledge graph integration**. Through frameworks such as **OntoPilot**, I develop **trustworthy AI workflows** by combining OWL DL reasoning, LLM logic plugins, and consistency checking to enhance interpretability and reliability in scientific AI.  

When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy teaching, open-source projects, and sharing ideas about science & technology.  
Beyond research, I actively participate in **volunteer and charity programs**, and Iâ€™m passionate about **sports, hiking, and outdoor adventures**.
