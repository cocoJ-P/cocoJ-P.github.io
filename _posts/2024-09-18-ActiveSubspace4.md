title: "Active Subspaces 4: Toward Nonlinear Manifold Learning"
date: 2024-04-29 23:36:10
description: Active Subspaces excel at finding linear combinations of variables, but many systems require nonlinear structure. We explore extensions such as generalized and deep active subspaces, and connect them with broader manifold learning and MosaicX-style atlas approaches.
