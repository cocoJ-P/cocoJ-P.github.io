title: "Active Subspaces 3: From Fluid Dynamics to Uncertainty Quantification"
date: 2024-04-29 23:36:10
description: A survey of how Active Subspaces are applied across physics and engineering. We highlight case studies in fluid dynamics, aerospace design, Bayesian inference, and uncertainty quantification, and show how the method naturally connects to dimensional analysis.
