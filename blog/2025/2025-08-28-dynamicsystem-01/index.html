These are models where the state evolves in time but does not explicitly depend on space, such as the pendulum, the logistic map, or the Lorenz system.</p> <p>While partial differential equations (PDEs) — like those in fluid dynamics — are also dynamical systems in a broader sense (infinite-dimensional ones), they belong to a different research community and require specialized mathematical and numerical tools. To keep this series focused and beginner-friendly, we will concentrate on ODE-based dynamical systems: their modeling, equilibrium points, stability, and basic numerical methods.</p> <hr> <p><strong>我们从单摆问题入手，开始一步步的结合 MosaicX 完成简单动力学系统的求解工作。</strong></p> <h2 id="1-单摆的动力学方程">1. 单摆的动力学方程</h2> <p>单摆的基本方程是一个二阶非线性 ODE：</p> \[\ddot{\theta}(t) + \frac{g}{L}\sin\theta(t) = 0\] <p>其中：</p> <ul> <li>$\theta(t)$：摆角</li> <li>$g$：重力加速度</li> <li>$L$：摆长</li> </ul> <hr> </body></html>
