# Pelton Turbine Parametric Modeling Tool

- **Date / Duration**: 2021–2022

## 1. Motivation 
This engineering project aims to develop a **parametric modeling tool** for designing a new *Pelton turbine bucket*, with design parameters **extending far beyond existing models**, in pursuit of **higher efficiency and reliability**. In this scenario, the **lack of both historical datasets and experimental data** makes traditional data-driven evaluation or benchmarking infeasible. Rather than keeping the geometry fixed and only tuning CFD conditions, our approach couples **parametric geometry modeling with CFD simulations**, enabling both domains to co-evolve through parameter variation. To this end, we are exploring an **automated workflow** that integrates the modeling stage with CFD into a **feedback loop**, iteratively refining the design until an **optimized model emerges**. This effort also represents the initial step toward my long-term vision — the development of a **“Machine Scientist.”**

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
